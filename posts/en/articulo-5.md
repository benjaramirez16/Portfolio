## A great result is not a coincidence; it's the product of a good process.

Creating an effective website goes beyond writing code. It's about understanding your goals and translating them into a clear and functional digital experience. To achieve this without surprises and ensuring the highest quality, I follow a clear 4-stage process.

### 1. Discovery and Strategy

It all starts with a conversation. We sit down (virtually or not) and I listen. What is your business? Who are your customers? What do you want to achieve with your website? In this phase, we define the key objectives so the project has a clear direction.

### 2. Design and Prototyping

With the objectives defined, I translate the ideas into a visual design. I create the page structure (wireframes) and then bring it to life with a design proposal (mockup) that reflects your brand and is easy for your customers to use. You review everything, and we don't move forward until you are 100% convinced.

### 3. Development and Construction

This is where the magic happens. I transform the approved design into code. I build each section, each button, and each animation with a focus on quality, performance, and adaptability to all devices.

### 4. Delivery and Launch

Once the site is built and approved by you, I put it online on a server and hand you the keys. I make sure everything works perfectly and explain how to use the necessary tools (like the contact form).

This process ensures that we are always on the same page and that the final result is exactly what your business needs.
