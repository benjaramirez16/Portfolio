## The Problem with CSS at Scale
When a project grows, CSS can become a monster. Overlapping selectors, duplicated rules, and the dreaded `!important` start to appear.
### The Solution: Modularity
The key is to divide. Using the partials architecture we've implemented in this portfolio (`abstracts`, `components`, `layout`...), we ensure that each piece of the UI has its own style file.
* **Maintainable:** If you want to change the button, you only touch `_buttons.scss`.
* **Scalable:** Adding a new section is as simple as creating a new file.
This approach isn't just a best practice; it's a necessity for any serious project looking to grow long-term.
