## The Power of Observation

Intersection Observer is a browser API that lets us know when an element enters or leaves the viewport (the visible part of the screen). This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing and animating our websites.

### Key Use Cases

* **Scroll Animations:** Triggering CSS or JavaScript animations only when the user sees an element.
* **Lazy Loading Images:** Loading images only when they are about to appear on the screen, saving initial bandwidth.
* **Infinite Scroll:** Loading more content as the user reaches the end of the page.

In my portfolio, I use Intersection Observer to create those subtle entrance animations that make the experience more dynamic without sacrificing initial performance.
