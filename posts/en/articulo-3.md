## Your digital storefront, open to everyone

Imagine having an incredible physical store, but the door is too narrow for some customers to enter, or the signs are impossible to read. The same thing happens in the digital world. Two principles are non-negotiable to prevent this: Responsive Design and Accessibility.

### 1. Responsive Design: Your website, perfect on any screen

Today, your customers visit you from their phones, tablets, and computers. Responsive Design ensures that your website adapts and looks impeccable on all of them. It's not a separate "mobile version"; it's a single, intelligent site that reorganizes its content to offer the best possible experience, regardless of screen size.

### 2. Accessibility (a11y): Building a web without barriers

An accessible web is one that can be used by anyone, regardless of whether they have a visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disability. This involves using colors with good contrast, ensuring keyboard navigation is possible, and making sure screen readers can understand the content structure.

For me, this is not an "extra." It's a fundamental part of building a quality product and a web that is truly open to everyone.
